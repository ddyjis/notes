# Structured Reading with Q/E/C

- Q/E/C stands for **Q**uestion / **E**vidence / **C**onclusion
	- Developed by Cal Newport
	- Allows us to breakdown information into "atomic" ideas. And we can make our own atomic notes

## How Does it Work

Learning is a passive process. When learning a new thing, **actively** restructuring and breaking it down would help.
