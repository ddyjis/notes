# React `setState` Updater is not Always Necessary

- An updater is a callback function to calculate the next state from previous state.
- It is common to see people recommend using updater i.e. `setAge(a => a + 1)` to update the state. It is not necessary in most cases.
- Most of the time it is the same as setting the state directly i.e. `setAge(age + 1)`
- Updater is required if there are multiple updates within an event.
