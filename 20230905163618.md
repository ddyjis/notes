# TypeScript Partial is Preferred over Undefined Record Value

`Partial` works for type annotation in this case

```typescript
enum Format {
  Color = "color"
  Size = "size"
}

const count: Partial<Record<Format, number>> = {};
```

`Record<Format, number | undefined>` does not

```typescript
enum Format {
  Color = "color"
  Size = "size"
}

// Will complain keys missing for `count`
const count: Record<Format, number | undefined> = {};
```
