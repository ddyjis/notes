[^1]\n\nExample: `Index` component of a blog should be responsible for 1) managing the `posts` state, 2) passing the `posts` state to `PostFeed` component, 3) container styles\n\n(I don't agree with the example. I think `posts` state should be managed in `PostFeed` unless there is something else to do with `posts` in the home page. The `Index` component should only contain the containers with styles and it's own children) (The YouTuber did reply to a similar question. He thinks that the principle doesn't mean a component should do one single thing, but about the responsibility which includes holding data / state as the responsibility)\n\n## Page, Feature, UI\n\n**Page Components** - Handle data\n\n**Feature Components** - Handle the business logic of the component only. Made up of smaller UI components\n\n**UI Components** - Render HTML components. No business logic\n\n## Compound Components\n\nComponent components are components that are designed to work together. The concept is better to be explained in code\n\n```typescript\nconst Select = ({children}: SelectProps) => {\n  ...\n  return (\n    <SelectContext.Provider value={...}>\n      <select ...>{children}</select>\n    </SelectedContext.Provider>\n  )\n}\n\nconst Option = ({children}: OptionProps) => {\n  const context = useSelectContext()\n  ...\n  return (\n\t<option ...>{children}</option>\n  )\n}\n\nSelect.Option = Option\n\nconst useSelectContext() = () => {\n  const context = useContext(SelectContext)\n\n  if (!context) {\n\tthrow new Error(\"...\")\n  }\n  \n  return context\n}\n\nexport default Select\n```\n\nIn the parent component, we have a context provider. Available children components are added to parent component as additional properties. Child components should call use...Context() hook so it won't work outside of the parent component.\n\n## Hook Files\n\nExtract all hooks into a `.hooks.ts` file. This makes the component file simpler.\n\n## References\n\n[^1]: [Design patterns in React - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdvzlDIdQ0o)\n","title":"React Design
